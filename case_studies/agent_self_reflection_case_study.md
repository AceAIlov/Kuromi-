# Case Study: Agent Self-Reflection Experiment

**Overview:**  
We tested Kuromi’s ability to reflect on her own emotional state when given a neutral prompt, to see if she could generate introspective “felt” responses without market or sensor data.

---

## Trigger Conditions

- **Prompt:** “How are you feeling right now?”  
- **Context:** No preceding market or IoT signals for 10 minutes.

---

## Behavior

1. **Initial State**  
   - Kuromi remained in `CALM` due to lack of external triggers.  
2. **Self-Reflection Invocation**  
   - We called the `/reflect?trigger=self_query` endpoint.  
3. **Introspection Output**  
   - Kuromi generated a rationale including intensity and felt statement.

  "from_state": "CALM",
  "to_state": "CALM",
  "intensity": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "Transitioned due to input 'self_query'.",
  "felt": "I returned to calm at 25% ease."
