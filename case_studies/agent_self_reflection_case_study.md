Case Study: Agent Self-Introspection Experiment (Sphinx)
Overview

Validate that Sphinx can perform self-introspection and produce a human-readable felt response (with an intensity score) without any external market/sensor signals.

Trigger Conditions

Prompt: How are you feeling right now? (neutral, self-query)

Assumption: No external signals received in the last 10 minutes (no clipboard/files/calendar/notifications).

Behavior

Initial state
With no external triggers, Sphinx remains in CALM.

Self-introspection call
We log a rationale for a synthetic trigger self_query.
(To produce a stable baseline in the audit trail, we first append the current CALM to history.)

Introspection output
Returns a rationale dict with UTC timestamp, prior and current state, an intensity in [0, 1], a brief reasoning string, and a concise felt sentence.

Reproducible Python (works with the Sphinx files we created)
# Requires:
#   Sphinx/agent/emotion_engine.py (EmotionEngine with CALM baseline)
#   Sphinx/agent/introspection.py  (Introspection with .log_rationale)
#
# Run this as a quick sanity check of the self-introspection path.

from Sphinx.agent.emotion_engine import EmotionEngine
from Sphinx.agent.introspection import Introspection

# 1) Start engine at CALM baseline
engine = EmotionEngine()
engine.reset()

# Append a baseline CALM entry to history so "from_state" is CALM, not None.
engine.react("baseline")  # maps to CALM and records it

# 2) Log a self-introspection rationale
ins = Introspection(engine)
rationale = ins.log_rationale("self_query")

print(rationale)

# Example output (timestamp will differ):
# {
#   'timestamp': '2025-07-05T08:30:00+00:00',
#   'trigger': 'self_query',
#   'from_state': 'CALM',
#   'to_state': 'CALM',
#   'intensity': 0.25,
#   'reasoning': "Transitioned due to input 'self_query'.",
#   'felt': 'Returned to calm at 25% ease.'
# }

Sample Log Entry (JSON)
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-05T08:30:00+00:00",
  "trigger": "self_query",
  "from_state": "CALM",
  "to_state": "CALM",
  "intensity": 0.25,
  "reasoning": "Transitioned due to input 'self_query'.",
  "felt": "Returned to calm at 25% ease."
}

Notes

If you skip the engine.react("baseline") step, from_state may be null (None) depending on your engine history, which is still valid but less illustrative.

The intensity includes a small random jitter by design; exact values will vary but remain within [0.0, 1.0].

Everything above is backend-only (no HTTP server required). If you later add an API surface, you can expose log_rationale behind a /reflect?trigger=self_query endpoint using your preferred framework.
